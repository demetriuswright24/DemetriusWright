## Git, GitHub

*What is the URL of the GitHub repo that you created in your personal account?*
https://github.com/demetriuswright24/DemetriusWright625
   
*In which direction does the 'push' command work (send local changes to remote OR send remote changes to local)?*
The direction that the 'push' command works is sending local changes of a project residing on your machine, to the remote repository. So, you push your local work to the remote

*You have committed a change on your local machine/remote. However, you want to undo the changes committed. How would you do that?*
You could revert to the last commit. First, you could run git log to see your previous commit. After doing that, you can run "git checkout theCheckoutId to update your current project that you're working on, to that of the commit of your choice

Additionally, you could do "git reset --soft HEAD^" or "git reset --hard HEAD^", dependent on whether you'd like to keep the progress you currently have on your work
